# Module_5-Challenge
pymaceuticals

-During this challenge most of the material referenced came from rewatching lectures as well as assistance during office hours. I also received help from fellow peers with clafication on the assignment requirements as it was not as clear as previous instructions for other assignments. 

-The final file with code submitted was the finish product of the startcode that was given for us to use. Most of the code for initializing each section of the .ipynb file such as the path to the csvfiles was used from the starter code. code was also mostly taken from inclass activities and can be found throughout the final file submitted for grading. I also referenced the previous Pandas assignment for the first half of the assignment as it was moderately similar. 

-chatGPT was used when further explinations or quick definitions where needed for a lot of the pandas and .plt methods that were used during this challenge. GPT was also useful for finding the correct syntax and formating of columns in certain dataframes aswell as for formating the .plt for each graph that was required. GPT was overall very useful for the graphing heaving parts of the assignment towards the end. 

- the submission requirements where not clear on what exactly was required when submitting this repo. I included the CSV files and overall submitted this assignment similar to how the PANDAS challenge was submitted. Please let me know if anything is missing and i will provide that for you. 

-As a side not, I did not finish the last graph on the assignment and accept the penalty on the grade.
